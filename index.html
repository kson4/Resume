                            Created a 32-bit MIPS processor using VHDL.
                            The implementation consists of a five-stage pipeline with all the
                            hardware architecture, instruction and data memory,
                            registers, ALU, control, and adders.

                            Created a web crawler that can calculate the page rank of all subdomains.
                            Currently has three different versions, standard page rank,
                            page rank with teleporting, and the random surfer model
